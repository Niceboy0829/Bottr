Pozi
====

This document aims to set out the design philosophy of Pozi against Botkit and
Hubot. This will help to drive and focus the direction of development by setting
out goals of the framework and how Pozi will be different compared to other frameworks.

Existing frameworks
===================

Pozi and existing frameworks aim to handle a lot of the boilerplate with making a Bot.
This handles communicating with clients such as Facebook, Twitter and Slack. Storing
information about a conversation, listening to messages and handling threading of
conversations.

Right now Pozi is built on these two frameworks to get the best of both worlds but
in the long term we would like to build out the parts that add the most value and reduce
it down to the elements we need (reducing dependencies).
